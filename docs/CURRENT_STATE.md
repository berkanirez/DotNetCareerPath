# CURRENT_STATE.md — Source of Truth for Current Progress

This file reflects the actual current state of the learning journey. It must always match reality. Update it only after a day's Definition of Done is confirmed satisfied (see `CLAUDE.md`).

## Status snapshot

* **Setup phase:** Complete
* **Roadmap phase:** Phase 1 — RoadmapOS
* **Week:** 1
* **Day:** 1 (complete)
* **Active project:** RoadmapOS
* **Status:** Day 1 complete — MVC scaffold created, builds and runs, one verified endpoint added independently
* **Available study time:** 2 hours/day
* **Progress:** ~1% (Day 1 of 110 total study days across the 22-week roadmap)

## Completed items

* `DotNetCareerPath` folder created.
* Root folder opened in Visual Studio Code.
* Claude Code installed.
* Planning documents created (`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/REQUIREMENTS_MATRIX.md`, `docs/LEARNING_LOG.md`).
* Git repository initialized (`git init`), no commit yet.
* `RoadmapOS.slnx` solution created.
* `src/RoadmapOS.Web` ASP.NET Core MVC project scaffolded (`dotnet new mvc`) and added to the solution.
* Build verified: 0 errors, 0 warnings.
* App run and verified manually: `/` returns the default MVC homepage (HTTP 200).
* Independent task completed and verified: `HomeController.Status()` action added, returns plain text via `Content(...)`, confirmed at `/Home/Status` (HTTP 200).
* SDK/runtime/solution/project, middleware pipeline ordering, and MVC view-resolution convention explained and understood.

## Decisions on record

* IDE: Visual Studio Code
* C# tooling: C# Dev Kit
* AI environment: Claude Code
* Target framework: .NET 10 LTS
* Teaching language: Turkish
* Code and documentation language: English
* First project: RoadmapOS
* First application type: ASP.NET Core MVC
* Primary database: SQL Server
* Claude must plan and explain before editing application files.
* Claude must wait for the explicit keyword `UYGULA` before implementing.
* Future technologies (auth, Docker, messaging, microservices, etc.) must not be introduced ahead of their scheduled phase.
* .NET 10's `dotnet new sln` produces `.slnx` (new XML solution format) instead of the classic `.sln` — functionally equivalent, noted for future reference.

## Next action

1. Read all five required documents (`CLAUDE.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md`, `docs/REQUIREMENTS_MATRIX.md`, `docs/LEARNING_LOG.md`).
2. Begin Phase 1, Week 1, Day 2: explain and plan the C# type system topics (classes, records, interfaces, nullable reference types) and first domain concepts, without persistence.
3. Wait for approval (`UYGULA`) before creating or editing any application files.

## Day 2 expected outcome

* Classes, records, interfaces and nullable reference types explained with Node.js/TypeScript-relevant comparisons.
* First domain concepts (e.g. `Skill`, `RoadmapItem`) modeled purely in memory, no persistence.
* No database, authentication, Docker or future technology added.
