# LEARNING_LOG.md — Session History

## Purpose

This log is the historical record of every completed learning session in the `DotNetCareerPath` roadmap. It exists so that progress, decisions, mistakes and understanding can be reviewed later — by Berkan, and by Claude at the start of future sessions.

## Rule

An entry is added **only after** a day's Definition of Done (see `CLAUDE.md`) has been fully satisfied. Do not log a session that is incomplete, abandoned, or only partially verified. If a session spans multiple days before completion, log it once, on the day it is actually completed.

### 2026-08-25 — Phase 1, Week 1, Day 1

**Topic:** Environment verification; SDK vs runtime vs solution vs project; first ASP.NET Core MVC scaffold.

**Problem solved:** Establishing a working, verified .NET development baseline and an accurate mental model that maps .NET tooling concepts onto already-known Node.js/npm concepts, so later days build on correct foundations instead of guesswork.

**What I learned:**
* SDK contains the runtime plus build tooling (compiler, CLI, templates, NuGet client); the runtime alone can only execute already-built apps — parallel to a full Node.js+npm install vs. a bare `node` binary.
* A solution (`.slnx`) is an organizational shell for one or more projects, similar to an npm-workspaces root; a `.csproj` is the actual buildable unit, similar to `package.json`.
* The ASP.NET Core middleware pipeline runs in registration order and later middleware can depend on state set by earlier middleware — `UseRouting()` must precede `UseAuthorization()` because authorization needs the endpoint match that routing produces.
* MVC resolves `return View()` (no argument) by convention to `Views/{Controller}/{Action}.cshtml`, falling back to `Views/Shared/`.
* `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` implicitly adds a FrameworkReference to the ASP.NET Core shared framework — not every .NET dependency is a downloadable NuGet package; some ship bundled with the installed runtime.

**What I implemented:**
* Initialized the Git repository (`git init`, no commit yet).
* Created the `RoadmapOS.slnx` solution.
* Scaffolded `src/RoadmapOS.Web` via `dotnet new mvc` and added it to the solution.
* Added `HomeController.Status()`, an action returning plain text via `Content(...)`.

**Runtime flow:** Browser request → Kestrel → middleware pipeline (exception handling in non-dev, HTTPS redirection, routing, authorization) → endpoint execution → controller action → for `Index()`, `View()` resolves and renders `Views/Home/Index.cshtml` through `_Layout.cshtml`; for `Status()`, `Content(...)` writes the response directly with no view involved.

**Verification:**
* `dotnet build` → 0 errors, 0 warnings.
* `dotnet run` + request to `/` → HTTP 200, correct page title.
* `dotnet run` + request to `/Home/Status` → HTTP 200, "RoadmapOS çalışıyor!".
* `git status` → `bin/` and `obj/` correctly excluded by `.gitignore`.

**Evidence:** Working endpoints (`/`, `/Home/Status`); English technical explanation (Q&A on middleware ordering, view-resolution convention, SDK FrameworkReference vs. NuGet PackageReference).

**Mistakes or difficulties:** None blocking. Noted that .NET 10's `dotnet new sln` defaults to the newer `.slnx` format instead of the classic `.sln`.

**Production considerations:** Verification used plain HTTP for simplicity — production requires enforced HTTPS with a real certificate; no secrets/config beyond framework defaults exist yet; no health-check endpoints yet; Bootstrap/jQuery are vendored directly into `wwwroot` by the template rather than through a real frontend build pipeline (out of scope until the Angular phase).

**Understanding questions and answers:**
1. Q: Why does `UseRouting()` have to come before `UseAuthorization()` and endpoint execution? A: `UseAuthorization()` inspects the endpoint that routing matched (e.g. its `[Authorize]` metadata); without a prior routing decision there is nothing to authorize against — same dependency-ordering logic as sequential Express middleware relying on state set by an earlier one.
2. Q: How does `return View()` find its `.cshtml` file with no name given? A: Convention over configuration — it looks for `Views/{CurrentController}/{CurrentAction}.cshtml`, then `Views/Shared/{CurrentAction}.cshtml`.
3. Q: How does the project build with zero `<PackageReference>` entries? A: `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` implicitly adds a FrameworkReference to the ASP.NET Core shared framework, which ships with the installed runtime rather than being resolved as a NuGet package.

**Independent task:** Add a `Status()` action to `HomeController` returning plain text via `Content(...)`; verify manually at `/Home/Status`. Completed and independently verified by Berkan; re-verified by Claude (build clean, HTTP 200, correct body).

**Next session:** Phase 1, Week 1, Day 2 — C# type system (classes, records, interfaces, nullable reference types) and first domain concepts, modeled in memory only, no persistence yet.

### 2026-09-01 — Phase 1, Week 1, Day 2

**Topic:** C# type system — classes, records, interfaces, nullable reference types; first domain concepts, no persistence.

**Problem solved:** Turning the skill-tracking concept already used by hand in `docs/REQUIREMENTS_MATRIX.md` into real, correctly-behaving C# types, while building an accurate mental model of how C#'s class/record/interface/nullable features differ from the TypeScript equivalents already known from professional Node.js work.

**What I learned:** The identity-vs-value distinction that decides `class` vs `record` (an entity tracked by a stable `Id` through changes, vs. an immutable fact defined entirely by its content); that `record` gives structural equality, `ToString()`, and non-destructive copying (`with`) for free, none of which a `class` has by default; that `List<T>.Sort()` with no arguments requires `T` to implement `IComparable<T>`, and that the absence of it fails at runtime, not compile time, because `List<T>` carries no compile-time constraint on `T`; that nullable reference types (`string?`) are enforced by the compiler at the point of use (`CS8602`), not just at declaration.

**What I implemented:**
* `SkillLevel` enum (`src/RoadmapOS.Web/Domain/SkillLevel.cs`) — the five-level scale from `REQUIREMENTS_MATRIX.md` as a type-safe value.
* `Skill` class (`src/RoadmapOS.Web/Domain/Skill.cs`) — mutable entity with `Id`, `Name`, `Category`, `CurrentLevel`, `TargetLevel`, nullable `Notes`; implements `IComparable<Skill>` (sort by level, then by name); computed `IsAtTarget` property.
* `SkillSnapshot` record (`src/RoadmapOS.Web/Domain/SkillSnapshot.cs`) — immutable point-in-time value type.
* Temporary `Development`-only console verification block in `Program.cs`, deliberately used to trigger and then fix a `CS8602` nullable warning, and to prove sorting, computed properties, and record value equality all behave as designed.

**Runtime flow:** All in-memory, at application startup, before `app.Run()` — no HTTP request involved yet. See `docs/daily-code-notes/day-02.md` for the full line-by-line trace of the verification block against its console output.

**Verification:**
* `dotnet build` → 0 errors; 1 intentional `CS8602` warning observed, then 0 warnings after the fix.
* `dotnet run` → console output matched every predicted value: sort order (`EF Core` → `SQL Server` → `ASP.NET Core` → `C#`, level-then-name tie-break), `IsAtTarget=False` for all four, null-safe `Notes` length for both a populated (`15`) and a genuinely-null (`0`) case, and record equality (`False` for a modified copy, `True` for an unmodified `with { }` copy).

**Evidence:** Working, verified domain code; English/Turkish technical explanation (extensive Q&A on identity vs. value, `IComparable`, `with`, nullable reference types); independent task completed and re-verified.

**Mistakes or difficulties:** None blocking. Needed extra guidance to locate the remaining unexplained lines in `Skill.cs` (constructor, computed property, `CompareTo`) and to design the independent task around the fact that `Sort()` changes list order, so a dedicated variable (`sqlServerSkill`) was used instead of an index.

**Production considerations:** This is intentionally throwaway verification, not a substitute for real tests — it will be deleted on Day 3. Real domain behavior will be verified with xUnit starting Day 7. As of today, a new practice began: a per-day Turkish code walkthrough file (`docs/daily-code-notes/day-XX.md`), documented as a language-rule exception in `CLAUDE.md`.

**Understanding questions and answers:**
1. Q: Why does `SkillSnapshot` have no `Id`? A: It has no identity to track — it's an immutable fact, not a thing that changes over time; two snapshots with identical values *are* the same fact, so value equality is the correct default.
2. Q: What would happen if `Skill` didn't implement `IComparable<Skill>` and `Sort()` was still called? A: It compiles fine (no constraint on `List<T>.Sort()`'s type parameter), but throws `InvalidOperationException` at runtime the moment it needs to compare two elements.
3. Q: How would `snapshotToday with { }`'s effect be reproduced by hand on a `class`? A: Manually construct a new instance copying every field — and even then, `==` would return `False` by default (reference equality), unless `Equals`/`GetHashCode` were also manually overridden, which is exactly the boilerplate `record` generates automatically.

**Independent task:** Add a fourth `Skill` (`SQL Server`) with `Notes` left unset; print its null-safe `Notes` length separately from the existing line. Completed and independently verified by Berkan (console output confirmed `0`); re-verified by Claude by reading the final `Program.cs`.

**Next session:** Phase 1, Week 1, Day 3 — ASP.NET Core request lifecycle (`Program.cs`, middleware, routing, controllers, views, DI) and the first real read-only vertical slice, replacing today's temporary console block with a `SkillsController` + view over the in-memory `Skill` list.
